# Props

## Demo

- Replace `00-practice-app/src` with [07-Ins_Props/src](../../01-Activities/07-Ins_Props/src) and run
  - Navigate through to the `Alert` component
  - Demonstrate the props that are being passed through (i.e. in this case `type` and `message`)
  - Unlike in plain old HTML, props can be anything: strings, numbers, arrays, functions, other components
  - These props are unidirectional: the data only flows from the calling code into the component

# Try

- Try [08-Stu_Props/README.md](../../01-Activities/08-Stu_Props/README.md)
