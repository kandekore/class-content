### JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a central component to React, and allows us to (almost) write HTML in JS files.

```jsx
const awesomeElement = <span>JSX is the best!</span>;
```

is the equivalent of

```js
const awesomeElement = React.createElement("span", {}, "JSX is the best!");
```
