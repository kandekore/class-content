# Little live exercise

Allow yourself around 15 minutes to try this. Feel free to try this in pairs or larger groups.

I may well ask someone to volunteer a live coding session.

Write a function that takes in two numbers and outputs the max (the greater of the two numbers).

Examples:

```
Input: 1, 2
Output: 2

Input: 6, -4
Output: 6

Input: 3.4, 2
Output: 3.4
```

You can start by using any of the following syntax.

```
const max = function(first, second) {
    // TODO
}
```

or

```
const max = (first, second) => {
    // TODO
}
```

or

```
function max(first, second) {
    // TODO
}
```
