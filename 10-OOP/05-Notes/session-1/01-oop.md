# Introduction

* Why split code into different files?
* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Heou5UD956vYb1d4YDCi4GobFCcz4geNifZmz0KISgg/edit?usp=sharing)
* Show students this week's mini project `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main`
* Open [01-Ins_Constructors/index.js](../activities/01-Ins_Constructors/index.js) in node
* Important to use the new keyword otherwise JS will start interfering with previous versions of the object.
* Classes start with a capital letter and can be identified by the use of `this` keyword
* Create a normal object and compare the output of the class to it.

## Try

* Open [02-Stu_Constructors/README.md](../activities/02-Stu_Constructors/README.md)
