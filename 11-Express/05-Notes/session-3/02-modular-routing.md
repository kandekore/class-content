# Modular routing

## Demo

- Open [21-Ins_Modular-Routing/server.js](../../01-Activities/21-Ins_Modular-Routing/server.js)
  - Split out into a `routes` folder with an `index.js`, and import in `server.js`, each sub-route file using `express.Router()`
- Open [23-Ins_Custom-Middleware/server.js](../activities/23-Ins_Custom-Middleware/server.js)
  - Why is it called Middleware?
  - Demo that middleware even runs on routes that do not exist
