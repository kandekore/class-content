# mySQL

## Demo

- Why SQL?
- As a rule of thumb, add an `ID` column on each table you create. Why is this important?
- Open MySql test DB [https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db) and see
- Talk about database schema [Employee db Scmema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/sakila-structure.html)
  - The database schema is a structure of a database described in a formal language.
  - As Database grows, the schema must be kept up to date
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;`
- Do an inner join. Note how quick it performs these actions.
- Very fast and very scalable. A db server can hold as many dbs as you like, each database as many tables, each table as many rows etc.
